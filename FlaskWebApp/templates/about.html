    <h2 align="center">ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING</h2>
    <p>The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in the year 1965. It is one of the oldest and premier engineering department of the university. The number of the students having completed their under graduate programme has reached the 1500 figure mark. The department has been playing a vital role in producing scientists and engineers of highest possible calibre ever since its inception. Apart from offering a bachelors degree programme in electrical engineering, the department also offers part time master degree programme in power electronics and control discipline and part time and regular doctor of philosophy programmes. The department has an annual intake of 33 students in the under graduate B.Tech. Programme. and 10 in Post Graduate M.Tech. Degree Programme and around 5 in PhD programme. The department has been playing a pioneer role in producing world-class engineers and research scholars.

The department has rich and experienced faculty members with very wide exposure.The department has distinguished faculty, all holding degrees from renowned institutes / universities. The faculty member(s) of this department has / have applied for patents, authored good number of books and guided good number of M. Tech. theses, Ph.D. theses. The commitment and dedication, punctuality, experience, expertise and enriched knowledge of the faculty members are few among many the distinguishing features of this department.

The passed out students have proved their mettle in various private and government organisations, public sector organisations, civil services, teaching & research, research & development and multi-national companies. Electrical Engineers rolling out of the institute are well groomed in the core areas of Advanced Control Systems / Power Electronics / Electrical Machines / Power Systems / Measurement and Instrumentation / Machine Design / Power Generation, Transmission & Distribution as well as Software Development/Handling and R&D work. The continuous updations in the course curriculum polishes the budding electrical engineers, in a way, so as to meet the challenges posed by newer technologies and reach the ever-expanding horizons and evolving challenges of industry.

The infrastructure and laboratory facilities are being upgraded from time to time so as to provide adequate opportunities to students and researchers to learn and carry out technological innovations. Financial support for this purpose if provided by the university and TEQIP World Bank. The department has Library, Basic Electrical Engineering Laboratory, Electrical Machines Laboratory, Power Electronics& Electric Drive Laboratory, Microprocessor & Control Laboratory, Power System Laboratory, Network Laboratory, Electrical Fabrication Laboratory, Simulation Laboratory, RTPESS Lab., Electrical Measurement Laboratory, Electrical Science Laboratory and Instrumentation Laboratory. The department has facilities to support teaching and learning activity The department had planned to add advanced laboratories in the areas of advanced control, machine intelligence and also personality development.

The department is continuously engaged in research and development activities. Several National and State level seminars, Technical Festivals, Faculty Development Programmes, Conferences, Symposiums, Expert Lectures, Workshops, Staff Training Programmes, Short Term Courses etc. are part of its yearly agenda. The department is applying for accreditation by National Board of Accreditation, (NBA). The department also undertakes many research projects sponsored by both the government, industry, civil societies etc..</p>
